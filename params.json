  "body": "## JappyBird\r\nA FlappyBird port in Java, made to run on anything! The goal of this project is to bring a very fun mobile game to PCs. Besides that, I want this game to be 100% dynmically scalable and eventualy feature alternate gamemodes/levels.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nOnce you have cloned this project on your pc, open eclipse and set the repository folder as your workspace folder. It should look something like this: yourDocuments/Github/JappyBird Once it is imported, compile/run the Game.java file to start the game.\r\n\r\n# Where are we so far?\r\nThe entire game is powered by a tick Thread that is located in Game.java. The tick thread runs the game at a constant tick while upscaling and downscaling the fps to prevent the game from slowing. Currently the fps cap is set at 60 fps.\r\n\r\nEach time the window is resized, all imported sprites are also resized to be proportional to the height of the window. Almost all movement variables are scaled by a static ratio Game.heightRatio(). So when the window is resized, the physics are scaled. \r\n\r\nIn the imported workspace, you'll find a todo.txt. If you are looking for inspiration, perhaps you may want to tackle one of those challenges. Just make sure you commit the changes to an appropiately named branch. Example: collision_detection_fix\r\n\r\n#Copyright Notice\r\nTake note that I am not affiliated with .GEARS Studios. I have only created the code for this project.
