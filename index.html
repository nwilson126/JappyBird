<p>A FlappyBird port in Java, made to run on anything! The goal of this project is to bring a very fun mobile game to PCs. Besides that, I want this game to be 100% dynmically scalable and eventualy feature alternate gamemodes/levels.</p>

<h1>
<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Once you have cloned this project on your pc, open eclipse and set the repository folder as your workspace folder. It should look something like this: yourDocuments/Github/JappyBird Once it is imported, compile/run the Game.java file to start the game.</p>

<h1>
<a id="where-are-we-so-far" class="anchor" href="#where-are-we-so-far" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where are we so far?</h1>

<p>The entire game is powered by a tick Thread that is located in Game.java. The tick thread runs the game at a constant tick while upscaling and downscaling the fps to prevent the game from slowing. Currently the fps cap is set at 60 fps.</p>

<p>Each time the window is resized, all imported sprites are also resized to be proportional to the height of the window. Almost all movement variables are scaled by a static ratio Game.heightRatio(). So when the window is resized, the physics are scaled. </p>

<p>In the imported workspace, you'll find a todo.txt. If you are looking for inspiration, perhaps you may want to tackle one of those challenges. Just make sure you commit the changes to an appropiately named branch. Example: collision_detection_fix</p>
